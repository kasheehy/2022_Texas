This observational experiment was designed to test whether fish behavior was affected by parasite load and whether those patterns differed between species.

Fish were collected by Kirsten Sheehy and Jon Aguiñaga. Behavioral data and fish lengths were extracted from videos and photos by Nishika Raghavan. Parasite data were collected by Dr. Jessica Stephenson's lab.

The code here cleans and analyzes behavioral data from BORIS, parasite data from Dr. Stephenson's lab, and data from Kirsten's physical lab notebook.
